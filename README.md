# Framer Motion Gallery
[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) -  a simple yet powerful motion library for React. 

It's easy to use, yet hard to master. 
That's why I decided to create a website with collection of Framer Motion animations and pages.

[//]: # (The main purpose of the website is to learn advanced animation concepts and make animations easier to be recreated by providing ready examples. )
The main purpose of the Gallery is to display a variety of animations you can create using Framer Motion,
help find inspiration, and provide examples that are ready to use and easy to customize.

The best way to learn Framer Motion is reading [docs](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and practicing. So fell free to share your examples and explanations!

I started learning Next.js less than a month ago, so if you have any suggestions to the website or want to help - feel free to contact me: [Discord](https://discord.com/users/366684552040808458)

Also, feel free to use any animations from this website in your projects.
